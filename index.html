                <h3>What is Disc Golf?</h3>
                <p>
                    Disc Golf has a history dating back to the 1960s. The disc or frisbee is patented by <strong>Ed Headrick</strong> who is also known as the Father of Disc Golf.
                    You throw the disc toward the <em>Disc Golf Pole Hole</em>. Scoring is tracked like golf, the smaller the number the better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Disc golf is a sport that combines the precision of traditional golf with the fun and excitement of frisbee.
                     Players use specially designed discs to complete each hole in the fewest throws possible. Whether you're aiming for 
                     a long-distance drive or a delicate putt, disc golf offers a unique challenge for players of all skill levels.
                </p>
